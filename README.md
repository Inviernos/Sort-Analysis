# Sort-Analysis
My program uses two sort algorithms. The two sort algorithms are quicksort and insertionsort. I use two vectors for the algorithms starting out with 100 numbers. I keep doubling the numbers until i get to 12800 numbers. Then i keep track of the number of steps needed for both algorithms. I show all these numbers within my excel sheet for my BigOh analysis.
